This is my initial version of a client/bot for Eternal Lands.
It should be viewed as a 'proof of concept'. The basic communication
and simple keeping of state should be fairly correct and the
the example bot Trader.pl successfully trades.

There is the beginning of more advanced functionality but it
is much less well developed. The way the higher level functions
are organised is quite likely to change in the future as I am
unsure as to what is part of the Client class the Bot class and
what should be in the instance script.

Also this is my first CPAN package, so le me know if I have
messed something up

The classes the package provides (all under Games::EternalLands)
are

Constants.pm
--------------
contains sensible name => value mappings for the Eternal Lands
protocol

Client.pm
-----------
contains the class for just the basic client
parts. It handles the following:-

    sending/receiveing packets
    decoding packets
    maintaining inventory
    simple trades (NO checking is done)

Bot.pm
------
    maintains a selling and buying list in YAML
    and checks that the both sides of the trade
    are correct
