Trader.pl is a simple Trade Bot.

Harvester.pl harvests lilacs in VOTD and sells them
to the flower shop

Hunter.pl kills animals that are defined in the canHunt
hash and picks up there meat. It also finds bread in bags
and eats it when needed. It may

Huntel.pl and Harvester.pl MUST NOT be run on the real
server - it will result in you being banned. If you wish
to experiment with this bot do so on the test server only

Do not run moer than one bot using the same 'knowledge.yaml' file,
it is quite likely to corrupt the file

If the bot seg faults(1), increase the process stack size with

  ulimit -s 32768

before running the bot

(1) and if anybody knows of an efficient way to flood fill
    an area where the boundaries are defined by height-maps
    let me know ;-)
